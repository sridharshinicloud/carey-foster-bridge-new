# **App Name**: BridgeSim

## Core Features:

- Resistance Adjustment: Interactive controls to digitally adjust known resistance values within the simulated Carey Foster bridge.
- Jockey Simulation: A draggable jockey to interactively explore and find the null point on the bridge, which indicates balance.
- Length Measurement: Clear, automatic display of the balance lengths (l1 and l2) corresponding to the jockey's position, updating in real-time.
- Data Recording: A data table to systematically record multiple sets of resistance values and balance lengths for analysis.
- Calibration Suggestion: An AI tool that recommends appropriate resistance values for different unknown resistances, optimizing experiment accuracy and clarity. Takes measured data and suggests resistance adjustments.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2C3E50) to convey a sense of scientific accuracy and stability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7) to provide a neutral backdrop for the interactive elements and data displays.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#3498DB) to highlight interactive elements and key data points, enhancing usability.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a clean, modern, and highly readable interface suitable for scientific data.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent bridge components and controls.
- A structured, grid-based layout to ensure information is presented clearly and logically, promoting ease of use.
- Subtle transitions and animations when adjusting resistance values or moving the jockey to provide visual feedback and enhance interactivity.
